Hey there! Have you ever wished you could transcribe audio in real-time like a court reporter? Well, now you can! And the best part is, you don't even need to be a fast typist.

I've created a web application using javascript that can listen to audio and turn it into text in real-time. It's super easy to use too!

To get started, just download the zip file and extract it into your folder. Then open it in your favorite IDE and install live server.

Once you've set up the environment, you're ready to start transcribing! Just go live with the HTML script and you'll see a microphone icon. Click on it and give permission to your microphone to record.

And voila! You're now ready to transcribe whatever you want by speaking into the microphone. The text will appear in the textarea above the microphone icon.

So what are you waiting for? Give it a try and let me know what you think!
